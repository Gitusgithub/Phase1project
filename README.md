# Airline Accidents Analysis

## Overview
This project looks at airline accident data to find patterns and insights about aviation safety.  
The dataset used is `airline_accidents.csv`, and I analyzed it using Python for data processing and Streamlit for building an interactive app.  
The goal was to take raw accident records and turn them into meaningful results and visuals.
